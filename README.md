# 🎵 Beginner-Friendly Machine Learning Project

Welcome!  
This is a **beginner-friendly** project to help you understand how to **train, test, and use a simple Machine Learning (ML) model** using **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and example datasets like `music.csv` and `vgsales.csv`.

This repository contains:
- ✅ A ready-to-run **Jupyter Notebook** (`ML.ipynb`)
- ✅ A **sample dataset** (`music.csv`)
- ✅ An **extra dataset** (`vgsales.csv`) for you to practice more

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── ML.ipynb               # Main Jupyter Notebook for training the model
├── music.csv              # Primary sample dataset (music preferences)
├── vgsales.csv            # Additional dataset for exploration or practice
└── .ipynb_checkpoints/    # Auto-generated Jupyter Notebook checkpoints (can be ignored)

🚀 What You Will Learn
By following this project, you’ll learn:

How to load CSV data using pandas

How to split data into input features & output labels

How to train a classifier using scikit-learn

How to make predictions on new data

How to save and load your trained model

⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have:
```
Python 3.7+

pip (Python package manager)

Jupyter Notebook
```
🛠️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone this Repository

```
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```
2️⃣ (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment
It’s a good practice to keep your dependencies isolated.

On Windows:


```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
You can use a requirements.txt (recommended):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
OR, install manually:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter
```
📝 Running the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:


jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window. Open ML.ipynb and run the cells one by one to:

Load the **music.csv** dataset

Train a simple ML model

Make predictions

Save or reuse your trained model

📊 About the Datasets

**music.csv**

A small dataset to predict music preferences based on age and gender.
Perfect for understanding classification.

**vgsales.csv**

A larger dataset with video game sales data.
Use it to practice building more complex models once you’re comfortable with the basics!

📌 Best Practices

The .ipynb_checkpoints folder is automatically created by Jupyter — you can ignore or delete it.

Use virtual environments to avoid conflicts with global Python packages.
